<p>(Recording duration: 29:55)</p>

<p><strong>Lester:</strong><br />
The way you’ve been doing it, the track wreck it is, and take almost forever. Because how long should it take to do a three-month job? Or three months or less. In other words, you were not doing it. You were toying with it, playing with it, using it to better what you really want, the world. If you were using it to go to the infinite being that you are, you already would have been free.</p>

<p>Does that make sense? So, what’s missing is your want-to. Your want-to is the world. And if it’s the world, it’s the opposite of your unlimited beingness.</p>

<p>And each Sunday, I’ve been trying to give you something really substantial to work with. Can you remember what the first one was? Anyone here remember?</p>

<p><strong>Audience:</strong><br />
Yeah. The first step is to let go of the world and focus on the freedom.</p>

<p><strong>Lester:</strong><br />
Right. That’s step No.1. And the step No.1 of the Method, isn’t it? “You’ve gotta want freedom more than you want the world”.</p>

<p>Let me change that around. That’s the way it was originally, but seen it be meaningless to people, so we changed it to “You must want freedom more than you want approval or control”, while approval or control equates to the world. But I think it’s better put “You must want freedom more than you want the world”.</p>

<p>And if you do, then what’s your behavior from there on, turning your head away from the world and focusing it back on you, doing that which is required to detach you from the world and allow your infinite beingness just to be. So, step No.1 is “You’ve got to want freedom more than you want the world”.</p>

<p>What was the second Sunday on? Do you remember?</p>

<p><strong>Audience:</strong><br />
Being up here again. Going for it? (Not clear)</p>

<p><strong>Lester:</strong><br />
Wasn’t that the last time?</p>

<p><strong>Audience:</strong><br />
You did it more than once.</p>

<p><strong>Lester:</strong><br />
Okay, the No.1 hold down is the wanting to survive as a body, which comes out as the fear of dying. Out of it evolves every other feeling? If I get everyone’s approval, I’m safe, I’ll survive as a body. If I can’t get their approval, I want to make them approve of me, so I’ll be safe in survive and that’s control.</p>

<p>But because you’re so fearful of allowing the feelings of the fear of dying to come up, you need to work with approval and control first. And when you release that appreciably, naturally up coms the bottom, fear of dying for you to release. But I think you’ve done enough on approval and control to directly attack the fear of dying. And work on that and work on that.</p>

<p>And when you get stuck, use the how-to in the method. Let go of wanting to change the feeling of stuckness.</p>

<p>If it’s a vague feeling, let go wanting to change that vague feeling, and <em>it</em> releases, and then you can attack the fear of dying feeling that first little release will allow you to move up to the place where you’ll discriminate and realize the fear of dying is only a feeling, and that right now you’re equating it to actual death, and that’s why you don’t allow it up.</p>

<p>If you didn’t equate the feeling of the fear, if you didn’t equate the fear of dying to death itself, you’ve got it right up, you go free in the matter of a week or two. And it is pushing hard to get up and get out. So, it’s the most suppressed feeling we have. And you’re doing a beautiful job of suppressing it and holding it down.</p>

<p>So last time we did something that’s been done for the very first time, focusing on the fear of dying feeling. I generally avoid it because most people jam on it rather than carry it through. But I think you’re ready, if you’re committed as you say you are, to allow the feelings of the fear of dying up and allow them to go out.</p>

<p>Could you hear that word Allow? That’s just the way it happens. Instead of holding it down, you allow it up and out, because it’s trying to push up and out all the time. Every suppressed feeling is. So, when you do it, it’s easy. Comes up in waves and goes out, until the waves stop, and then you’re finished.</p>

<p>I want to give you a another very practical thing that’ll help you go free, and it is this: “Whatever you do, whatever you want now, get it by releasing only”. Whatever you want, get it by releasing only. I’m underlining “only”.</p>

<p>Now, it might kill you because it’s so easy. It drops into your lap.</p>

<p><strong>Audience:</strong><br />
Kill you. (Laugh)</p>

<p><strong>Lester:</strong><br />
Is there anyone who has not experienced getting something with no effort through releasing?</p>

<p>So, every one of you has experience getting something just through releasing, no effort, no doing, just releasing, and it drops into your experience.</p>

<p>What’s wrong with that?</p>

<p><strong>Audience:</strong><br />
(Laugh) Hah, hah, hah……</p>

<p><strong>Lester:</strong><br />
Yeah. What’s wrong with that? (Laugh)</p>

<p>You have done it. You’ve got it more than once, and all things are possible when you do it that way.</p>

<p><strong>Audience:</strong><br />
I just don’t want an elephant falling in the lap. (Laugh)</p>

<p><strong>Lester:</strong><br />
OK, so the point I’m making now is, from here on, everything you want, make it a point to get it via releasing.</p>

<p>Do you think you got to write that down? I’m afraid you’ll forget it the moment I stop talking to you. That means your life is going to be beautiful from here on.</p>

<p><strong>Audience:</strong><br />
Oh, God.</p>

<p><strong>Lester:</strong><br />
Oh God is right. (Laugh)</p>

<p><strong>Audience:</strong><br />
You put away all of our work clothes … here comes the lemonade.</p>

<p><strong>Lester:</strong><br />
From here on, get everything you want by releasing.</p>

<p>Alright, now, what will that do? It’ll get you into the habit of releasing. It’ll get you to use it more and more and more, until it’s natural, like breathing.</p>

<p>Now your greatest prize is not going to be the getting of the things that you want, but in your state of beingness, you’ll move into that high, high, high state. Because when you let go by releasing, it’s letting go and letting God. Can God do it? You need money? Does God have money? He could give you a trillion dollars tomorrow if you would let Him.</p>

<p><strong>Audience:</strong><br />
(Laugh)</p>

<p><strong>Lester:</strong><br />
It’s just a letting, basically. It’s a letting go of the ego sense, I need my body mind, letting go of the ego senses, letting God do it. It’s letting the God part of you, your beingness do it. That’s simple, isn’t it? What I’ve said so far
Okay, what you need is a, uh, these electrical prods that the Chinese authorities used yesterday on a mobs in Beijing, try to break them up.</p>

<p><strong>Audience:</strong><br />
Cattle prods.</p>

<p><strong>Lester:</strong><br />
Cattle prods. There are electric shocks. Yeah, it’s an idea.</p>

<p><strong>Audience:</strong><br />
It just reminded me that idea on one Star Trek movie where the controllers were with brains in a glass jar, controlled this population, and they had hooked up to every person, a gadget, and the person that thought a wrong thought, they would ding…</p>

<p><strong>Lester:</strong><br />
Find out where they bought them.</p>

<p><strong>Audience:</strong><br />
Home Depot.</p>

<p><strong>Lester:</strong><br />
And maybe that’s why we need to set up here as a Home Depot with a capital “H”,
“H” for heaven highest.</p>

<p>But this isn’t an assignment, from here on, produce everything you want by releasing until it gets to be permanent. When it’s permanent, you’re awfully close to being free.</p>

<p><strong>Audience:</strong><br />
I’m a little confused. I mean, we take no action, physically?</p>

<p><strong>Lester:</strong><br />
No, in your mind, you take no action, when you release, and you let it happen, your body goes through the motions, but you have a sense of being not the doer. It’s not me, but the Father who worked through me, is the sense. It’s letting go of I me ego sense and letting God run the body.</p>

<p><strong>Audience:</strong><br />
That’s what I did when I … (Not clear)</p>

<p><strong>Lester:</strong><br />
Do it all the time. Things get to be effortless. You’ll be surprised. It’s almost like this. Now, to lift your arm takes effort. If you release, your arm floats up with no effort. And that applies to everything. There’s no effort.</p>

<p>When you let go of the ego sense, there’s no effort. It drops into your experience. When you do it enough, you’ll learn to create instantly. That means materializing and dematerializing things. For this process, you’ll learn to materialize, even gold.</p>

<p>Of course, when you got the formula for making gold, you don’t want to carry it around with you. It’s heavy. The only thing you think of is what you want, what you need. You produce things for use, not to store up, storing up it shows uncertainty, the feeling I can’t have, so, I better build it up for the future.</p>

<p><strong>Audience:</strong><br />
Our society is around save money, save money. (Not clear)</p>

<p><strong>Lester:</strong><br />
How many pockets does Bob he have in his … (Not clear)</p>

<p><strong>Audience:</strong><br />
(Not clear) (Laugh)</p>

<p><strong>Lester:</strong><br />
They never carry things with them. If they want something, they materialize it.</p>

<p>So again, starting today, we get everything we want through releasing. And I suggest you put up a chart, a sign in your room.</p>

<p>“Get everything <em>only</em> through releasing”.</p>

<p>I think you need to really put it up over your mirror where you’re looking at, at least once in the morning, wherever it’s obvious put it up in a very obvious place, because it’s obvious that even though you’ve released more than once in a… achieve something dropping into your experience, you don’t want to remember it. You prefer to do things a hard way. You love to gravel, (laugh) and this will take you out of your hovel of gravel (Laugh) and help you solve all problems.</p>

<p><strong>Audience:</strong><br />
Um, the thing about we love to gravel.</p>

<p>Um. I had an awareness a couple of weeks ago.</p>

<p>I was asking myself, why don’t I let God do it?</p>

<p>Why am I struggling? And the answer came, because if God does it, then you don’t get the approval, you know, so that was a very good I, we don’t want them to do it so we get the approval.</p>

<p>What good I did, look how I struggled.</p>

<p><strong>Lester:</strong><br />
Every time you have released completely on something, no matter how impossible it was before you released, it became immediately possible when you released, no matter what it was, no matter what it was, I’m saying that to dare you to think big.</p>

<p>I’ve said so so much, and what I’ve said to you so far, I feel like cutting it now and letting you stay with that. Do you have any questions?</p>

<p><strong>Audience:</strong><br />
Question about what the second week was, we covered the first, third and fourth. I was to hear that, just the fifth week dinner. There were several things you talked about. One of the weeks I was gone. I wonder what I was.</p>

<p><strong>Lester:</strong><br />
Were you there when we decided to release directly on the fear of dying?</p>

<p><strong>Audience:</strong><br />
Yeah, that was last week.</p>

<p>So oh, the the weekend, the question you were answering that week was, how to get there faster? How to increase your want-to?</p>

<p><strong>Lester:</strong><br />
And what was the answer to that question?</p>

<p><strong>Audience:</strong><br />
(Laugh) Just do it.</p>

<p>The Decision.</p>

<p><strong>Lester:</strong><br />
That was it.</p>

<p><strong>Audience:</strong><br />
(Laugh) I didn’t do the one that asked the question didn’t go up.</p>

<p><strong>Lester:</strong><br />
Answered it so well, I told the guy, when you make the decision to go free, it comes rapidly.</p>

<p><strong>Audience:</strong><br />
(Laugh) Over tree?</p>

<p><strong>Audience:</strong><br />
And the other question I have is about releasing on the fear of dying.</p>

<p>I don’t understand you to mean that in our workshops that we should even go as far as instead of asking, is that an approval or control or is that survival?</p>

<p><strong>Lester:</strong><br />
Yes, under the approval and control.</p>

<p>The workshop leader, Hale, will then ask you, look at the fear of dying underneath it.</p>

<p><strong>Audience:</strong><br />
Okay.</p>

<p><strong>Lester:</strong><br />
The reason why you want approval or control is so that you’ll survive. So, it’s up to the workshop leader to lead you further down.</p>

<p>Now, if they jam, then release them on their feeling of being jammed. And when I come, when that’s let go of then they can confront again the fear of dying, that they jam is just running away from the fear of dying, as though the feeling is tantamount to death.</p>

<p>You can keep reminding them, it’s only a feeling. The fear of dying is only a feeling. Feelings don’t bite. They don’t shoot you. They don’t hit you over the head.</p>

<p><strong>Audience:</strong><br />
They can keep you bound (Laugh). (Not clear)</p>

<p><strong>Lester:</strong><br />
No, you do.</p>

<p><strong>Audience:</strong><br />
(Not clear)</p>

<p><strong>Lester:</strong><br />
It’s only a feeling, like every other feeling. But the tendency to run away from it is very strong and very habituated.</p>

<p>So now you’ve got to make the effort to get it out and get it out. And once you start letting it up and letting it out, you’ll discovery you don’t die each time the feeling comes up, you survive. So, you can look at it again and again.</p>

<p><strong>Audience:</strong><br />
And it came to mind that Annrika said … in one workshop which was very good,</p>

<p>this guy was releasing on his neighbor, so for the neighbor, and he couldn’t do it. So she said, well, release on this paper cup on the table. And then he did. She says, it’s the same thing. It’s the feeling, doesn’t matter what it’s on, it’s the same thing.</p>

<p><strong>Lester:</strong><br />
And then he released on the neighbor. Okay, that’s one of the ways of a leader taking a person through a release. If you can’t release anything, you release on, on the wall. You like the color, don’t you like the color? So, what you’re telling me is she’s using a process that works.</p>

<p><strong>Audience:</strong><br />
So, we can use the same thing, I guess.</p>

<p>And up, you know, when it comes up and it comes a little well and start releasing on something in the room.</p>

<p><strong>Lester:</strong><br />
Well, no, now you’re contradicting what I said. See, now you’re going way down to the elementary way of releasing. I’m trying to hold you up at the postgraduate level. I’m taking you out of grammar school, high school, college, and putting into the postgraduate college work.</p>

<p>You know, release the feeling of stuckness. See how you want to change things that I tell you.</p>

<p><strong>Audience:</strong><br />
 Yeah, I sure do.</p>

<p><strong>Lester:</strong><br />
Release only the feelings of the stuckness, or even the vagueness of the feeling you might not even see it, because you’re trying to run away from it, release wanting to change that vague feeling whatever it is. That goes out, then you’re able to approach the fear of dying again.</p>

<p>Now also needs to be thrown in the fear of living, which is the opposite side of the same coin.</p>

<p><strong>Audience:</strong><br />
It’s also helped me to work on one today.</p>

<p><strong>Lester:</strong><br />
Because it is in a lot of us, wanting to die, to get away from everything, so wanting to live, wanting to die, fear of dying, fear of living, those four things can be played with.</p>

<p>Maybe you got to write them down. Now this is having astounding…</p>

<p><strong>Audience:</strong><br />
(Not clear)</p>

<p><strong>Lester:</strong><br />
This will lead to an astounding change in every one of you. And it will if you carry it through. You’re being asked to do that, which will get you free rapidly.</p>

<p>You can do it here, because you don’t have the world telling you just the opposite, pulling you in just the opposite direction. Here, you don’t have the world pulling so you can stay with it.</p>

<p><strong>Audience:</strong><br />
Oh, I was working on the fear of dying one time. I brought up a lot of heavy physical pain, so I must have been doing something wrong, but it took a long time to work through it.</p>

<p><strong>Lester:</strong><br />
Instead of releasing it, you were expressing it on the body. You were making the body die. Pain is towards death. So instead of releasing it, you are expressing it into the body.</p>

<p><strong>Audience:</strong><br />
So, I get into that again, and I’d have to say, I think that slowed down my releasing when that happened. After that, still haven’t let go of I’m aware it was. So, what can I do to get through that again?</p>

<p><strong>Lester:</strong><br />
Talk to the workshop leader, let him take you through it. Or keep releasing the stuck feelings.</p>

<p>See, instead of releasing the stuck feeling, you kept it going. You were stuck with the stuck feeling, and you kept it stuck.</p>

<p><strong>Student:</strong><br />
Stuck with pain.</p>

<p><strong>Lester:</strong><br />
Can you see how simple it is? It’s really simple if you’ll do it.</p>

<p>Alright, now you got me propping Hale, and Hale will prop you, and we’ll all be proper in the future. (Laugh)</p>

<p>Which means releasing the fear of dying, getting everything we want via releasing only, doing it without effort. Be not the doer. We can’t to aid your intellect. Let’s just letting go and letting God. And I think you accept that God can do it. If he can’t, I’ll get you another guy who can. But it’s a let go and let God experience, and it drops into your experience, into, right into your lap with no effort.</p>

<p><strong>Student:</strong><br />
I have a question about the approval program and the control program, we’re wanting approval and if we can’t get approval, then we want to control so we can get approval. Is that what you said? Okay, how does that work when, okay, you’re sitting in your room and, um, there’s an insect and you want to control that.</p>

<p><strong>Lester:</strong><br />
Why don’t you answer these questions yourself?</p>

<p><strong>Student:</strong><br />
Okay.</p>

<p><strong>Lester:</strong><br />
Why do you have to have me answer a question like that? You see why you want me to answer it?</p>

<p><strong>Student:</strong><br />
No. (Laugh)</p>

<p><strong>Lester:</strong><br />
You want my approval; you want my attention.</p>

<p>A question like that, you can answer. See now you’re bothered because you feel maybe I’m putting you down. I want to approve of you. But all these little intellectual questions you can answer yourself, and they get you nowhere. Fast. They take the place of releasing, instead of releasing your questioning things, the whys, and wherefores of things <em>never</em> give you any answer. They just satisfy the intellect, which is a thing you want to get rid of.</p>

<p>So please release only. Don’t ask whys. Why this, why that. It’s a dumb question in the first place, because asking why now, why isn’t it the way I think it should be? That’s all you’re saying. Whenever you ask why, you’re asking someone to explains it so it fits in with your knowledge, which is lower than college, that’s down in elementary school.</p>

<p>So, try to get out of the habit of why, questioning. Just do it. Throwing up whys is specifically avoiding doing it. So, get wise, kill the whys, get W-I-S-E, and kill the W-H-Y-S.</p>

<p>OK, I think we can end the session.
