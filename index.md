Step 1: You must want freedom more than you want the world.

Step 2: Decide that you CAN do the method and be imperturbable.

Step 3: See that all your feelings culminate in three wants, the want of approval, the want to control, and the want of security. See that immediately and immediately let go of the want of approval, the want to control and the want of security.

Step 4: Make it constant. Release all your wanting approval, wanting to control and wanting security when alone or with people.

Step 5: If you are stuck, let go of wanting to control the stuckness.

Step 6: Each time you use the method, you are lighter and happier. If you do this continually, you will continually be lighter and happier.
